Hello! If you are there, then... there is nothing to watch. Lmao, you do not have to be there, just get another stealer compiler and get your friend's IP adress.
But, if you really want to watch something there, then...  Idk. And dc.

## What are your language levels?
So, i'm very-very new to programming. I know only several functions in Python and that's all. Here is my percents of knowledge:

|  Status | Language  | Knowledge  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Learning ðŸ”· |  Python | 15% ðŸ§’
| Paused ðŸ”¶  |  AHK | 50% ðŸ§‘
| Planning ðŸ”¹  | C#  | 0% ðŸ‘¶
| Planning ðŸ”¹  | Py libs  | 5% ðŸ‘¶

All my projects or "polygons" left from the learning languages are in the same repository. Python is in the folder Py, AHK in AHK and other.
Also, i speak russian, so many things in my codes are written on the russian, sorry, it's just not cool for me to write on english or my born language polish.

## What is you learning history?
I started programming back in 2020, when I learned what is HTML5. When i practically memorized almost every thing per month, my eyes saw some AHK farming scripts in some games. They was interesting, so I learned some from AHK from AHK documentation. Now i can easily create GUI's to generate things in Minecraft (tellraw generator and holograms generators is in the AHK folders, you are shocked, yea?)
