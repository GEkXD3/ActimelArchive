# aaactimel code archive
Hello! If you are there, then... **there is nothing to watch**. Lmao, you do not have to be there, just get another stealer compiler and get your friend's IP adress.
But, if you really want to watch something there, then...  Idk. And dc. That is just my archive where i can save my codes to not lose them.
**Also I will use this in future like portfolio.**

## What are your language levels?
So, I'm very-very new to programming. I know only a few functions in Python and that's all. **Here is my knowledge percentage**:

|  Status | Language  | Knowledge  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Learning ðŸ”· |  Python | 15% ðŸ§’
| Paused ðŸ”¶  |  AHK | 50% ðŸ§‘
| Planning ðŸ”¹  | C#  | 0% ðŸ‘¶
| Planning ðŸ”¹  | Py libs  | 5% ðŸ‘¶

All my projects or "polygons" left from the learning languages are in the same repository. Python is in the folder Py, AHK in AHK and other.
Also, **i speak Russian, so many things in my codes are written on the Russian**, sorry, it's just not cool for me to write on English or my native language Polish.

## What is you learning history?
I started programming back in 2020, when I learned HTML5. I practically memorized almost every thing per month, my eyes saw some AHK farming scripts in some games. They was interesting, so I learned some from AHK from AHK documentation.

Now i can **easily create GUIs** to generate things in Minecraft *(tellraw generator and holograms generators is in the AHK folders, you are shocked, ya?)* and some other things, but i paused my AHK learning journey and switched to Python. 
Now, very-very slowly (because of school), i'm learning Python and then i want to learn some libs to make more thingies and enter the real development stage.

I will update this repository every time I upload new code.
